<h1>My Past </h1>
<p>Before becoming a mom, I was pursuing the dream of becoming a model and actress. Well maybe not pursuing but was living out my dream of being a model and an actress. I competed in several beauty pageants, my first when I was 14 years old. Some of these pageants include Miss Teen New York as well as Miss Teen Earth. Not only was I in the pageant industry but I was also at the time getting gigged for several photoshoots and music videos. I worked with a designer whom became like a brother to me, who goes by the name of Victor Lopez in which I did my first fashion photoshoot. I was also very fortunate enough to play as an extra on ABC's <em>One Life to Live.</em> I also modelled wigs. </p>
