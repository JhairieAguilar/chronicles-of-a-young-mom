<h1>Ways to Keep the Romance Alive</h1>
<p>No one ever wants to worry about that spark dying  between you and your partner. A lot of people think that once that spark goes away, there is nothing that can be done. When this happens, this is not the time for you to give up on each other. Instead it is the time where both partners need to come together and communicate about how they are feeling towards one another. The key to a successful relationship is to treat it like if it is a new romance. Take advantage of the new technology and send each other lovey dovey texts like in the beginning. Hold hands, hug and give quick kisses often is all that can be done in other to show the other person that you are thinking of them and care for them. Also, it is important to go out on dates often. Dress up and look the very best for each other. That feeling of desiring to look your best, feel your best and have the best time possible will rejuvenate those feelings of a first date. You can never go wrong with writing an old fashioned love letter. Reading letters from each other will only send the message that you are constantly still thinking about one another and those feelings are still alive and well. And even if we spend day and night thinking of things our partner does not do anymore, try concentrating on the things that he/she does now. Stregthen the art of conversation and learn something new together. And remember that none of this can be achieved unless you are a good listener and take care of yourself, your mind, body and spirit. </p>
