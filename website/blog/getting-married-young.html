<h1>The Benefits of Getting Married Young</h1>
<p><img src="../images/marriage.jpg" width="383" height="306"> </p>
<p>Many people may be against marriage at a young age. They may tell you &quot;you are too young to know about love<br>
  &quot;. But I am here to change that stereotype and tell you guys that I got married at the age of 21 and I dont regret it. And here are the reasons why. 
</p>
<h3>1. We grow up together.</h3>
<p>My husband is just one year older then me. I remember him at the age of 19, which is when I met him. Over the past few years I can already see a change in him and the man he has become. It is nice to have someone witness the progress we both have made.</p>
<h3>2. It's easy to combine our lives.</h3>
<p>When we met each other we were still babies. We did not have a career set, we did not intrude into each others lives. Most importanlt, there were no complication so it was rarely easy joining our lives together.</p>
<h3>3. We learned the hard lessons sooner rather than later.</h3>
<p>With the birth of our son, we had to mature quickly and transform into adults quickly as well. There were things we had to sacrifice. </p>
<h3>4. We have shared every milestone and achievement.</h3>
<p>Everything we have accomplished, whether it be seperately or together has been celebrated. And I love the fact that we can celebrate each others accomplishments as being ONE.</p>
<h3>5. Crazy, wild memories? Yup we have them all.</h3>
<p>My husband and I can go on for days talking about the &quot;old days&quot;, and all the wild memories we made with our young romance. </p>
<h3>6. We are happier!</h3>
<p>For some reason being married has made us happier. We love the fact of going through life with each other. </p>
<h3>7. We have got nothing but time. </h3>
<p>We are young. We have only been married for a year and some change now. But we have enough time to go on vacations and experience the world together and maybe even have more little munchkins. </p>
<h3>And lastly, I came across a great quote which stated, </h3>
<p>&quot;My young marriage can give me that much more time with the one person who&rsquo;s stuck by my side through every stage and evolution â€” and loved me through them all. The one person who has been there for every milestone and moment, and who knows every past version of myself. At the end of it all, time is what matters.&quot;</p>
