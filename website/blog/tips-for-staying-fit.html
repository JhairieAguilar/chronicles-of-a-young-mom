<h1>Tips for Staying Fit </h1>
<p>The one thing that roamed my head after birth was getting back into shape. I did not know where to start. It felt almost impossible to get back on my feet and get the pre-pregnancy bod I once had. Well listen up moms! Here are some tips on getting out and about and getting back your own figure. </p>
<h3>1. Walk it out</h3>
<p>Instead of picking up those car keys before heading out the house to run those errands, how about a quick run instead or a nice bike ride to where you have to be. While driving is faster, running, walking and biking are the healthier options. </p>
<h3>2. Exercise with the kids</h3>
<p>Find ways to exercise with your children. By doing this not only are you getting your workout in but you are also teaching your children how to be active. </p>
<h3>3. Sweep that fat away</h3>
<p>Turn daily chores into your daily workout routine! Just turn up the radio and dance the day away.</p>
<h3>4. Canned goods for weight lifting</h3>
<p>Use things around the house to help you with your workout routine. And it saves you a ton of money that won't be spent on weights. </p>
<h3>5. Bring the Personal Trainor to you </h3>
<p>Nowadays all we see online are workout videos. Inside of spending the day slouching on the couch wishing your fat should just melt away, find workout videos to help keep you stay on track.</p>
<h3>6. Getting fit in the office </h3>
<p>The next time you think about taking the elevator, think twice and just take the stairs. </p>
